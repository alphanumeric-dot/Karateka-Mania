I am NOT the original creator of this project! I'm not actually sure who made this. It was created sometime in 2006, if the original README is to be believed.

Oh, yeah, and the game is bundled with a README, but it's almost entirely corrupted. Also, since this is pre-Fever, the SFX and graphics all have that DS crunch and there's no comboing and offbeat pots (even though they appeared in Remix 9 DS... guess the devs forgot about it).

This was the first mania game ever made, preceeding Bouncy Road Mania and Polyrhythm Mania. And Spaceball Mania too, but that one's been unofficially cancelled. Hope you enjoy!
